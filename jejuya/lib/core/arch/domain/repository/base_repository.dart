/// This abstract class serves as the base repository for all repositories in
/// the application.
///
/// All repositories should extend this class to ensure consistency in the
/// codebase.
///
/// The [BaseRepository] class provides a template for implementing the
/// repository pattern in the application. It defines a set of methods that
/// should be implemented by all repositories, such as fetching data from a
/// data source.
///
/// By extending this class, repositories can inherit these methods and
/// implement their own custom logic on top of them. This helps to ensure
/// consistency in the codebase and makes it easier to maintain and update the
/// application over time.
